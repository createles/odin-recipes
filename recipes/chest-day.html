    <h2>Chasing that immaculate chest pump? All you need for a guaranteed fulfilling chest-day are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat-barbell bench press</li>
        <li>Incline seated cable-flyes</li>
        <li>Deficit push-ups</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Workout-flow</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start your workout by warming up your shoulders and chest; a resistance band is an excellent accessory to getting the muscle fibers primed through pre-activation reps!</li>
        <li>Begin your working sets with the heaviest and most technical lift of the three: the barbell bench press. Focus on completing the range of motion using an appropriate weight that is challenging enough to be performed with good form.</li>
        <li>Once you're done, proceed to the cable machines and set up a seat with an incline. The degree of inclination will vary, but as a general rule, somewhere between 30-45 degrees of incline works best to shift the load from your primarily your shoulders to your chest.</li>
        <li>The last exercise to be performed for this workout are deficit push-ups. These are best set-up with blocks/weight plates on the ground at a height that allows a decent degree of stretch for your chest at the bottom of the movement.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Now go feel your chest ripping through your shirt!</h4>
